 Synthesis: Chemical Engineering ManualWelcome to the official documentation. The Synthesis mod brings the Periodic Table to Minecraft, not as generic ores, but as elements with real physicochemical properties.🧪 Core ElementsElementSymbolClassificationMain UtilityLithiumLiAlkali MetalEnergy Storage and High-Density Batteries.BerylliumBeAlkaline EarthPrecision sensors, mirrors, and aerospace components.SodiumNaAlkali MetalThermal transfer (cooling) and explosive reactions with water.MagnesiumMgAlkaline EarthLightweight alloys, intense lighting (Flares), and biological catalysts.PotassiumKAlkali MetalLife support (Oxygen), advanced fertilizers, and explosives.🛠️ Advanced Equipment1. Potassium Superoxide Canister"The violent chemistry that generates the breath of life."A closed-cycle life support device essential for deep ocean mining.Chemical Formula:$$4KO_2 + 2CO_2 \rightarrow 2K_2CO_3 + 3O_2$$Function: Unlike magic potions, this canister utilizes an exothermic chemical reaction. It absorbs the Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$) exhaled by the player and releases pure Oxygen.How to Use:Keep the item in your Main Hand or Offhand.When diving, if your air level drops, the canister will activate automatically.Warning: The device emits a rhythmic gas sound while operating. When durability runs out, the chemical reagent is depleted, and the item will break.2. Beryllium Tectonic Resonator"Where compasses fail, resonance prevails."A long-range geological triangulation tool. It utilizes the unique atomic rigidity of Beryllium to detect biome-specific tectonic micro-vibrations.Technology: Passive Seismic Sensor / Acoustic Interferometry.HUD (Heads-Up Display): When holding the item, a tactical visor appears on the screen showing the scan status.Calibration (Input):Hold SHIFT + Right Click on any block.The scanner will "lock" onto the frequency of the biome you are currently in (e.g., Desert).Scanning:Right Click in the air.The device will send a pulse within a 6,400 block radius.If the biome is found, the exact coordinates will be written to the item's memory chip and displayed on the HUD.The HUD will show the real-time distance to the target.⚛️ Hazard GuideAs in real life, alkali metals must not be handled lightly.Extreme Hydrophobia: Items or blocks made of pure Sodium or Potassium must never touch water. The reaction is exothermic and violent (Explosion).Beryllium Toxicity: Handling Beryllium dust without proper protection may cause adverse health effects (Poison/Damage).📜 Changelog (Alpha 0.1)Added: Ore System (Lithium, Beryllium, Sodium, Magnesium, Potassium).New Item: Potassium Superoxide Canister with audio loop mechanics.New Item: Beryllium Tectonic Resonator with custom GUI Overlay (HUD).Fixed: Loot tables and ore drops configured.
